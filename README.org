* Sudoku Solver
This is a Sudoku solver written in the Zig programming language.

** Building
The solver can be built with a simple Zig command. The required Zig version is ~0.15.1~.
#+begin_src sh
  zig build --release=fast
#+end_src

The binary is then located at ~./zig-out/bin/sudoku~.

** Running
Each Sudoku puzzle is represented by a single line of 81 characters.
These characters represent the cells in the Sudoku grid. If a value
is set, write respective character =[1-9]= at its position.
If a cell is empty, indicate this by writing a dot =[.]= symbol.

These puzzles can then be passed into =stdin=, for example via by ~cat~-ing
file contents or ~echo~-ing the puzzle.
#+begin_src sh
  # Solving a single puzzle with the echo command
  echo "..43..2.9..5..9..1.7..6..43..6..2.8719...74...5..83...6.....1.5..35.869..4291.3.." | ./zig-out/bin/sudoku
  # Solving a bunch of puzzles written in a file
  cat ./puzzle-file | ./zig-out/bin/sudoku
#+end_src

You can also type the puzzles directly into the program, one-by-one.
#+begin_src sh
  ./zig-out/sudoku
#+end_src
